# SaphraONE

SaphraONE is now organized as an npm-workspaces monorepo.

## Layout

- `apps/web` - Next.js frontend and API routes.
- `packages/contracts` - Hardhat config, Solidity contracts, ABI/bytecode artifacts, and deploy scripts.
- `packages/scripts` - Circle/AppKit operational scripts for wallets, transfers, swaps, and bridge flows.
- `packages/database` - Supabase SQL schema assets.

## Common Commands

Run commands from the repository root:

```sh
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run typecheck
npm run test
```

Contract and script commands are also routed from the root:

```sh
npm run contracts:compile
npm run contracts:deploy
npm run contracts:deploy-swiftbatch
npm run create-wallet
npm run batch-wallets
npm run send-tokens
npm run bridge
npm run swap
npm run send
```

## Earn (USDC yield)

Earn uses Circle App Kit's Earn vaults (Morpho, ERC-4626) on whichever Arc
network the app targets: `Arc_Testnet` on testnet, `Arc` on mainnet. SaphraONE
does not run its own yield vault.

Auto-Save deposits go through `EarnAutoSaveExecutor`, which pulls a user's
approved USDC and deposits it into one ERC-4626 vault in the user's name:

```sh
EARN_VAULT_ADDRESS=0x... pnpm --filter @saphra/contracts deploy:earn:autodeposit
```

- UI: `/earn`
- Executor: `packages/contracts/contracts/earn/EarnAutoSaveExecutor.sol`
- `GET/PUT /api/earn/auto-save` and `/api/earn/auto-deposit`: Auto-Save rules (explicit auth)
- `GET /api/cron/earn-auto-deposit`: runs due Auto-Save deposits (Bearer `CRON_SECRET`)

Auto-Save never drains below `min_idle_balance`. With `EarnAutoSaveExecutor` + USDC allowance + operator key, cron can execute; otherwise runs stay `awaiting_wallet`.

## Swift+Save (non-interest savings)

Swift+Save is a **non-interest-bearing** savings system: pockets + Spend&Save. There is **no APY, yield, interest, lending, or investment return**. Funds stay in USDC/EURC and are segregated from the spendable wallet via `SwiftSaveVault`.

```sh
pnpm contracts:compile
pnpm --filter @saphra/contracts test:save
pnpm contracts:deploy-swiftsave
```

Copy `NEXT_PUBLIC_SWIFT_SAVE_VAULT_ADDRESS` from deploy output into `.env`.

## Going live on Arc mainnet

SaphraONE is built to flip from Arc Testnet to Arc mainnet when official network details are published. Do not invent a chain ID, RPC, explorer, or token address.

1. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ARC_NETWORK=mainnet`.
2. Copy official Arc mainnet values into `ARC_MAINNET_CHAIN_ID`, `ARC_MAINNET_RPC_URL`, `ARC_MAINNET_EXPLORER`, `ARC_MAINNET_USDC`, `ARC_MAINNET_EURC` (and the matching `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` token/RPC/explorer vars).
3. Deploy **new** contracts on mainnet — do not reuse testnet addresses:
   - `pnpm --filter @saphra/contracts deploy:swiftpaysend:mainnet`
   - `pnpm --filter @saphra/contracts deploy:swiftsave:mainnet`
   - existing Earn / SwiftBatch / escrow / recurepay deploy scripts
4. Point env at the new mainnet addresses. Savings custody is immutable; the launch vault already includes `depositFor` so payment + fee + Spend&Save stay one transaction.

Apply SQL: `packages/database/supabase/swift-save.sql`.

| Surface | Path |
|---------|------|
| UI | `/save` · pocket detail `/save/[id]` |
| Contract | `packages/contracts/contracts/save/SwiftSaveVault.sol` |
| Schema | `packages/database/supabase/swift-save.sql` |

### APIs

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `GET/POST /api/savings/pockets` | List / create pockets |
| `GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/savings/pockets/:id` | Detail / update / archive |
| `POST/PUT /api/savings/pockets/:id/deposit` | Initiate / confirm deposit (`Idempotency-Key` header) |
| `POST/PUT /api/savings/pockets/:id/withdraw` | Initiate / confirm withdraw (`Idempotency-Key` header) |
| `POST /api/savings/refunds` | Create REVERSAL/ADJUSTMENT after payment refund |
| `GET /api/savings/transactions` | Unified savings history |
| `GET /api/savings/summary` | Dashboard totals |
| `GET/PATCH /api/savings/notifications` | In-app notifications + mark read |
| `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/spend-save` | Config (DELETE = disable) |
| `POST /api/spend-save/pause\|resume\|disable` | Toggle aliases |
| `POST /api/spend-save/quote` | Server-side quote (target-capped + fee breakdown) |
| `POST /api/spend-save/prepare\|complete` | Orchestrate savings leg after payment |
| `GET /api/spend-save/history` | Spend&Save history (`/events` also works) |
| `GET /api/cron/save` | Reconciliation worker (Bearer `CRON_SECRET`) |

Balances only update after on-chain confirmation. Spend&Save is enforced server-side: payments require balance for **payment + savings** (+ fees). Target pockets can **stop at target** or **continue beyond**.

```sh
pnpm --filter @saphra/web test:save
pnpm --filter @saphra/contracts test:save
```

### Wallet modes

| Mode | Deposit / withdraw / Spend&Save second leg |
|------|--------------------------------------------|
| External (wagmi) | `approve` + `SwiftSaveVault.deposit` / `withdraw` via `writeContract` |
| Circle embedded | Circle `createContractExecution` (approve + vault calls) via W3S SDK |

### Refunds / reversals

1. `POST /api/savings/refunds` → creates **PENDING** `REVERSAL` (audit trail; original row unchanged)
2. Client executes `vault.withdraw` (external or Circle)
3. `PUT /api/savings/refunds` with `transactionId` + `txHash` → confirms from on-chain receipt  
   Or use **Reverse refund** on a completed `SPEND_SAVE` row in `/save` history (runs the full flow).

## Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` at the repository root for contracts and scripts. The web app also loads the root `.env` through `apps/web/next.config.mjs`, so existing root-level environment files continue to work.

## Account activity

The dashboard's Activity board shows every confirmed transaction on the
account, labelled with the feature that performed it — Send, Request Payment,
Payroll, Circle, Swap, Invoices, Save, Earn, BatchPay, RecurePay and ALLIE.

`GET /api/activity` reads each feature's own records (savings transactions,
Earn deposits, payroll runs, invoice payments, recurring executions, agent
payment intents, circle ledger entries) and merges them with the
`account_activity` ledger, which the browser-side flows write through
`POST /api/activity`. The dashboard then matches the wallet's on-chain
transfers to those records by transaction hash, so a transfer no feature
claims still lists as wallet activity.

Apply SQL:

```sh
packages/database/supabase/account-activity.sql
```

Configure (optional, defaults to `account_activity`):

```sh
SUPABASE_ACCOUNT_ACTIVITY_TABLE=account_activity
```

## Traction analytics

SaphraONE includes real traction instrumentation for investor and operator reporting. It records product events into Supabase and aggregates actual MAU-style active wallets, stablecoin volume, transaction count, payment success rate, savings AUM, indexed Earn AUM, registered wallets, and recurring schedules.

Apply SQL:

```sh
packages/database/supabase/traction-events.sql
```

Configure:

```sh
SUPABASE_TRACTION_EVENTS_TABLE=traction_events
TRACTION_ADMIN_SECRET=...
```

Surfaces:

| Surface | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `POST /api/traction/events` | Server-side ingestion for app telemetry |
| `GET /api/admin/traction?rangeDays=30` | Admin JSON summary, Bearer `TRACTION_ADMIN_SECRET` |
| `/admin/traction` | Live admin dashboard for real traction metrics |

The dashboard reports actual tracked data only. It does not invent MAU, AUM, or transaction volume. Existing product tables are also used where available: profiles, savings transactions, Earn deposits/withdrawals, and recurring schedules.

Implementation notes and event naming: `docs/traction-analytics.md`.

SwiftBatch and SwiftRecurepay charge a **1% platform fee** (100 bps).

```sh
PLATFORM_FEE_RECIPIENT=
NEXT_PUBLIC_PLATFORM_FEE_RECIPIENT=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SWIFTBATCH_ADDRESS=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SWIFTRECUREPAY_EXECUTOR_ADDRESS=
```

`PLATFORM_FEE_RECIPIENT` receives the fee (SwiftBatch and RecurePay).  
Fee transfers to that address are **hidden from the end-user transaction history** feed.  
Redeploy contracts after fee constant changes (`pnpm contracts:deploy-swiftbatch`, `pnpm contracts:deploy-swiftrecurepay`).
